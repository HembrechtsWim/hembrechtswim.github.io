                    <h4>System Engineering &amp; Analysis - Stock management system</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the course System Engineering &amp; Analysis we were given a project in groups of four students.
                        Each group received a problem from a customer (teacher) that we had to find a solution for.
                        Our problem was about the expiration date of products in supermarkets.
                        We had to find a way to track the expiration date of the products so the system knows which products are being sold and which expiration date they have.
                        <br>
                        This way it is easier to keep track of which products expire, when they expire and how many there are.
                        This way non-profit organizations can be contacted in time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the semester we had a few meetings with our customer so we could understand the problem.
                        This way we had a better idea of what the functional requirements as well as the non-functional requirements of the system were.
                        <br>
                        Then we had to think of a way to make a proof of concept that we would later develop.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
                    <figure class="unicenta">

                        <figcaption>Unicenta</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-10 col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        After the exams we had five days to develop this proof of concept.
                        We didn't change anything in the existing system apart from the database.
                        We added a few collumns to the database so the system was able to store of the expiration date of products.
                        Then we started to develop a web interface so this data could be monitored via a website.
                        On this website employees could easily see when products would expire.
                        We also added the functionality to send an email to the non-profit organizations.
                        <br>
                        We haven't done anything with actually scanning the products so the date would be entered automatically because we weren't fully prepared at the start of the project week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So next time we should prepare more so we don't lose time doing research during the actual project week.
                        Apart from that I learned to work better in a team and what it would be like to have a real client or customer in the future.

                    <h4>IoT Essentials - Raspberry PI internet radio</h4>
                    <p>
                        During the course IoT Essentials we received an individual project.
                        We had to create an internet radio using a Raspberry Pi and some other components.
                        The radio had to be able to play 4 radio stations and change the stations by turning a potentiometer.
                        This had to be visually visible. By turning another potentiometer we had to control the volume.
                        All this data had to be displayed by an LCD screen.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <figure class="pi col-lg-5 col-md-5">

                <div class="col-xl-5 col-md-7">
                    <p>
                        I worked out this project step by step.
                        First ensure that the radio can play one radio station.
                        Then try to let the volume change, and so on until all the requirements were completed.
                        After all the programming was done and everything worked fine I created a box out of Lego.
                        Everything would then fit in the box so that it would look more like an actual radio.
                        I used my 3D-printer to create some parts so everything would be held in place inside the box.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-10">
                    <p>
                        With this project I started well in advance so I would have plenty of time to finish it,
                        and so I would still have enough time for other projects.
                        Sometimes I got stuck on some part of the project so I would take a break and try again a few days later.
                        After the break it always went smooth again.
                        By doing this I learned that you sometimes need to take a break from a project in order to continue.
                        But in order to do that you need time. So that's one of the reason why you should always start early.

                    <h4>Orientation Project - Cloud &amp; Cybersecurity</h4>
                    <p>
                        During the first year we received two orientation projects to determine our trajectory for the coming years.
                        These projects were in groups of 4 people.
                        In the second project I chose the Cloud & cybersecurity project.
                        We had to develop a camera surveillance system using a few components:
                        Watchguard Firebox, HP switch, Server and IP cameras.
                        There were also some requirements for this project.
                        <br>
                        &rarr; We had 2 cameras of which one had to be at school and one at home.
                        <br>
                        &rarr; We also had to use 2 IP cameras on the internet.
                        <br>
                        &rarr; The camera images had to be backed up.
                        <br>
                        &rarr; We had to monitor the network.

                    <p>
                        At the start of the project, we as a group looked at how we could achieve everything.
                        We started by designing and setting up a network.
                        After that, we looked at which technologies and protocols we needed for the cameras,
                        monitoring and backups.
                        These are the programs we ultimately chose:
                        Zoneminder for the cameras, Netdata for the monitoring and Rsync and Gzip for the backups.
                        All these programs ran on our server.
                        This server itself, of course, also had an operating system.
                        As operating system we used Fedora.

                <div class="col-xl-10">
                    <p>
                        Since this project only lasted five days and one day was planned for the presentations of the final results, we only had 4 effective days to get everything working.
                        Of course, this meant that we couldn't dwell too long on everything and had to make quick decisions.
                        This did not always work out well and because of this we have only provided a simple solution for our backup method.
                        But our team did work well together and we complemented each other quite well.

                    <h4>Project Hosting - Hosting platform (Ongoing)</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the project hosting course we have to design and set up a hosting platform,
                        which can then be used by the App-AI students to host their PHP projects.
                        This is of course way too much work for one person,
                        which is why we do this in a group of six people.
                        To host PHP projects we obviously need a few things.
                        A web service with PHP on it and a database.
                        And we as administrators must of course also be able to monitor everything.
                        We will run this hosting platform on a data center at school that we have at our disposal.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <figure class="schema col-xl-6 col-md-7">
                    <img src="Images/My%20Schema3.PNG" alt="Schema" title="Schema">
                    <figcaption>
                        Schema
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <div class="col-xl-5 col-md-6">
                    <p>
                        In the image above you can see what the schema of our platform looks like for now.
                        We use different servers,
                        each with its own task so that no server is overloaded and has to do too much.
                        This is to avoid downtime. Of course,
                        this platform must also be safe and only people with permission are allowed to access our server.
                        To achieve this we use a Pfsense firewall as a gateway.
                        Of course, we also need to make backups of everything to prevent data loss.
                        Backups only come in handy when it's too late. To ensure that it does not come to that,
                        we will also monitor everything. All this is of course a lot of work,
                        to make our work easier we will of course try to automate as much as possible.
                        We will do this with Puppet.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-5 col-md-6">
                    <p>
                        For the time being, we are still very busy with this project, so we don't really have many results yet.
                        But this doesn't mean we haven't learned anything yet.
                        At the start of the project we started a bit too slowly,
                        so we now have to work hard to get everything finished on time.
                        We have also run into some problems for which we did not immediately find a solution.
                        In the future it is therefore certainly important that we ask for help if we need it.
